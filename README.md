WebStorm initialized project doesn't work at the first place for me.
The following steps need to be setup:

1. Create a React Native project in WebStorm.

1. Open the Android project with Android Studio, sync Gradle, build and run.

1. Back to WebStorm terminal, execute:

    ``>npm install``
    
    ``>npx react-native run-android``

1. Done.
